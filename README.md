This repository holds source code for the GEANT4 training examples created by 
Physino. I'm learning "from scratch" to enhance my knowledge, having preiously 
relied on altering a (very conveniently) similar example for my PhD research. As
 time goes on I believe I will be using GEANT4 in a wider range of contexts. I 
also would like to learn C++ to a greater standard. I will be doing these 
learning exercises alongside the C++ textbook.

### MinGLE
Mini GEANT4 Learning Example. The "smallest GEANT4 application in the world."

Example B1 is the most basic example shipped with GEANT4. I had previously just 
used it as a text case for whether or not my installation was working. This 
exercise deconstructs and rebuilds it to highlight what each of the most basic 
GEANT4 elements do.

#### Requires
> Geant4, version 10.7 or greater, installed under Linux (for multithreading)
> Cmake 2.9 or greater
> C++ compiler such as g++/gcc 4.9 or greater (comes with Ubuntu)
